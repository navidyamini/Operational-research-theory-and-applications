# Operational-research-theory-and-applications
This is the project that we did for the "Operational research: theory and applications" course in the Polytechnic University of Turin (Polito). In this course we used Python and XPress-Mosel. The main aim of the course is to provide students with theoretical and operational tools for modeling and solving Operations Research and Optimization problems usually met in the design and the management of complex infrastructures such as computer networks. Operations Research deals with the mathematical modeling of complex problems and related solution algorithms.
